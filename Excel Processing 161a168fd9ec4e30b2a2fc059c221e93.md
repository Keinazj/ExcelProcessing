# Excel Processing

## This project is for working with excel files. You can read the comments from the cells and fill the empty cells with the correct values as you want. You can also count how many times a specific value is repeated somewhere.

In the first part of the code, there are some comments written in the comment section of each cell. The code reads the comments and randomly fill the value of the cell with one of those names in the comment. ***Each name can not be repeated in one row.***

---

In the second part of the code, you can keep count of how many times a specific name is repeated somewhere. It reads an input file which is a filled excel file and process that to find the counts. Then, the output which contains of the details is saved in a text file.
